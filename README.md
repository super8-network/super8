What is super8?

Super8 is an experimental digital currency that enables anonymous, instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Super8 uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Super8 Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
